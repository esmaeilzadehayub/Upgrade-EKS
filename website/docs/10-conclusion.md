In conclusion, this workshop has provided valuable insights into streamlining the Cluster upgrade process through automation. The adoption of a GitOps approach, coupled with the deployment of add-ons, significantly simplifies the upgrade process. With Fluxv2 ensuring that our repository reflects the installed add-ons, we can confidently proceed with cluster upgrades. Additionally, leveraging Fargate to host all add-ons offers the advantage of eliminating the need to manage underlying infrastructure, further easing the node upgrade process. Finally, we have gained knowledge on the usefulness of Karpenter, which ensures that newly spun-up nodes match the Control Plane API version, aiding in the upgrade step. Overall, these techniques and tools enhance the efficiency and reliability of cluster upgrades.
